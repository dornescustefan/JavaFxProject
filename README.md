# JavaFxProject
Java Fx application written in Intellij

This is desktop application for which I used JavaFx with Event handling,
Thread API and Stream API. It can be used as a back of house restaurant software system. 
It handles orders, communicates between waiters and kitchen, 
helps with food timing and also controls the payment.
